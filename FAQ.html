                At SFU, a few of my upper level Criminology courses went over how technology would have a greater impact on how crimes would be committed and how almost every criminal case has some form of digital evidence whether it be from computers, mobile phones, or tablets. Furthermore, one of my professors talked about Stuxnet, which really did it for me. I was like "Now that's what I want to do, I want to prevent those things from happening."

                For a really long time at SFU, I always wanted to be a lawyer of some sort. I wasn't too thorough on what kind of law I wanted to practise, but eventually, because of the massive amounts of reading a lawyer has to do and with the amount of reading I was receiving from 1 Criminology course, it kind of threw me off. I also realized that my grades just wasn't high enough to be accepted into law school. And it just so happened that I took two Cybercrime courses (upper level Crim courses) around this time.

                Right now, I work as a security guard at Gastown. My coworker and I patrol around Gastown as the odd person from East Hastings comes into Gastown to disturb people. They also might try and steal things from stores or break into cars. It's kind of a entry level job to policing. Of course, we do get very minor requests to deal with sleepers, which I think isn't appropriate or necessary, but it's part of the job.

                I used to do security in the really east side of downtown, that's where all the 'action' is, and for a time it's actually fun in a way, as you are always on your feet and anything can happen. The most interesting action packed story that happened in Gastown was where my coworker and I had to run after a thief for about two blocks. The thief was swearing and causing a disturbance while he was putting clothes on himself (he was stealing from a clothing store).
